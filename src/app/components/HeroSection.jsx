            A software engineer who loves untangling technical puzzles with
            people, not just for them. My journey into tech began with late
            nights, endless tutorials, and a stubborn belief that anyone can
            learn to code. That hustle paid off when I became a founding
            engineer at Elocity, where I wore every hat imaginable, from
            debugging at 2 AM to collaborating with tech team on product vision
            and brainstorming roadmaps over chai.
